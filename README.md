hosted page for adding the Saudi Riyal.
<br>the css3 only calls for one glyph in the NotoRiyal.woff2 which is the Riyal symbol U+FDFC (ï·¼)

```
@import url('https://adam-saeed.github.io/Saudi-Riyal-font/css3.css');

body, * {
    font-family: 'your regular font', 'Saudi Riyal';
}
```

you should host the font file on your own server for high traffic use
